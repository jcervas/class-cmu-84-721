# Chapter 2: Information, predispositions, and opinion

## Introduction
- The chapter aims to delve into the mechanics of how opinions are shaped, with particular focus on attitudes. This introduction sets the stage by acknowledging the complex ways in which attitudes are molded and changed over time. It stresses the importance of understanding these mechanisms, given that attitudes are central to a host of human behaviors, including politics.

## Attitudes as Considerations
- This section challenges the simplistic notion that attitudes are fixed or rigid. It introduces the concept that attitudes are made up of various "considerations." These considerations are like different variables that contribute to the overall formation of an attitude. The text speaks of how even people who share demographics or political affiliations can show considerable variation in their attitudes.

    ### Sampling Error
    - This subsection introduces the idea of "sampling error" to explain why people who are exposed to the same set of information might still hold varying opinions. Sampling errors occur when the individuals form their opinions based on different subsets of the total available information or "considerations." This creates a source of variability in public opinion even when the public is exposed to the same information.

## Political Awareness
- The role of political awareness is examined, suggesting that people who are more politically aware are likely to have attitudes that are more stable over time. However, these individuals are also more susceptible to attitude change when presented with new information, particularly if it is framed in a way that resonates with their pre-existing beliefs or "considerations."

    ### Political Values
    - The text discusses the importance of underlying political values, suggesting that they act as a sort of lens through which new information is viewed. For instance, someone with strong environmental values may be more likely to absorb and agree with new information that confirms the importance of climate change action.

---

## Schema Theory
- The section introduces the concept of "schema," borrowed from cognitive psychology. A schema is a mental framework that organizes past experiences and guides the interpretation of new information. For example, if someone is introduced as a "forty-year-old professor," different qualities would be noticed compared to if the same person was introduced as a "forty-year-old mother of three."

    ### Multiple Schemas
    - Here, the text delves into the idea that individuals have multiple schemas for understanding a given subject or concept. These multiple schemas can influence what qualities are noticed and how new information is interpreted. Different schemas can also result in varying attitudes toward the same subject, depending on which schema is activated at a given moment.

## Decision-Making Processes
- This part of the chapter tackles the convoluted process of decision-making, covering factors like perception, memory efficiency, and motivation. Despite the complexity, a single piece of information can dramatically affect an individual's opinion.

    ### Top-of-the-Head Decisions
    - The text discusses the tendency for many individuals to make quick decisions based on readily accessible information or considerations. This idea is termed as "top-of-the-head" decisions, which often occur because life is too short and the human mind too fallible to consider all available information.

    ### Comprehensive Decisions
    - In contrast, the text also speaks of comprehensive decisions that involve a wider range of considerations. This method is more deliberative and may involve weighing numerous "likes" and "dislikes" about a subject before reaching a conclusion.

---

## Summary
- The chapter wraps up by reiterating the complex interplay among various levels of information, attention to this information, and individual political values. It introduces a model based on these ideas, which will be detailed in the next chapter, that seeks to explain how the "considerations" available to individuals influence their responses to survey questions and decisions in general.


# Chapter 3: How citizens acquire information and convert it into public opinion

## Introduction

- Introduces the Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) Model as an alternative to existing models of public opinion.
- Argues that traditional models are insufficient to explain the complexity and dynamism of public opinion.

### The Problem with Existing Models

- Criticizes existing models for assuming a static, unchanging 'true attitude' in individuals.
- Discusses the limitations of the "conventional 'true attitude' model" and the "on-line model" for explaining public opinion.

### The Four Axioms

- Introduces the four axioms of the RAS Model but does not go into detail.
  
## Information Flows and the Sampling Axiom

- Discusses the significance of information flows in shaping public opinion.
- Focuses on the 'Sampling Axiom,' which posits that people sample from available considerations to form an opinion at the moment of inquiry.

### The Crux of the Argument

- Highlights the importance of situational variables and considerations in forming an opinion.
- Argues that individuals may sample different considerations based on the issue at hand, making public opinion dynamic rather than static.

### Challenges to the Sampling Axiom

- Addresses objections to the Sampling Axiom, noting it is a generalization but one that holds in most cases.
  
## The RAS Model and Other Theories

- Compares the RAS Model to other prevalent theories like the 'on-line model.'
- Criticizes the 'on-line model' for being unrealistic in its expectations of how people process political information.

### Why the On-line Model Falls Short

- Argues that the on-line model is impractical because it expects people to update a range of attitudes based on each piece of new information.
- States that the on-line model is simply a restatement of the conventional "true attitude" model, which has been shown to be inadequate.

### Terminology: From "True Attitudes" to "Opinion Statements"

- Introduces the term 'Opinion Statement' as a more accurate descriptor than 'true attitudes' for what the model proposes.
  
## How the Model is Used in This Book

- Explains how the four axioms will be used throughout the book to explore various aspects of mass opinion in different political environments.

### Methodology of the Book

- Outlines the methodological approach, which involves deducing implications from the four axioms and testing them empirically.
  
### Preview of the Argument

- Provides a preview of how the RAS Model will be used to explain changes in public opinion based on various factors like political awareness and changes in information flow.

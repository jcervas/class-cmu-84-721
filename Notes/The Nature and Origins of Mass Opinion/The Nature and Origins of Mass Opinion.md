# Chapter 2: Information, predispositions, and opinion

## Introduction
- The chapter aims to delve into the mechanics of how opinions are shaped, with particular focus on attitudes. This introduction sets the stage by acknowledging the complex ways in which attitudes are molded and changed over time. It stresses the importance of understanding these mechanisms, given that attitudes are central to a host of human behaviors, including politics.

## Attitudes as Considerations
- This section challenges the simplistic notion that attitudes are fixed or rigid. It introduces the concept that attitudes are made up of various "considerations." These considerations are like different variables that contribute to the overall formation of an attitude. The text speaks of how even people who share demographics or political affiliations can show considerable variation in their attitudes.

    ### Sampling Error
    - This subsection introduces the idea of "sampling error" to explain why people who are exposed to the same set of information might still hold varying opinions. Sampling errors occur when the individuals form their opinions based on different subsets of the total available information or "considerations." This creates a source of variability in public opinion even when the public is exposed to the same information.

## Political Awareness
- The role of political awareness is examined, suggesting that people who are more politically aware are likely to have attitudes that are more stable over time. However, these individuals are also more susceptible to attitude change when presented with new information, particularly if it is framed in a way that resonates with their pre-existing beliefs or "considerations."

    ### Political Values
    - The text discusses the importance of underlying political values, suggesting that they act as a sort of lens through which new information is viewed. For instance, someone with strong environmental values may be more likely to absorb and agree with new information that confirms the importance of climate change action.

## Schema Theory
- The section introduces the concept of "schema," borrowed from cognitive psychology. A schema is a mental framework that organizes past experiences and guides the interpretation of new information. For example, if someone is introduced as a "forty-year-old professor," different qualities would be noticed compared to if the same person was introduced as a "forty-year-old mother of three."

    ### Multiple Schemas
    - Here, the text delves into the idea that individuals have multiple schemas for understanding a given subject or concept. These multiple schemas can influence what qualities are noticed and how new information is interpreted. Different schemas can also result in varying attitudes toward the same subject, depending on which schema is activated at a given moment.

## Decision-Making Processes
- This part of the chapter tackles the convoluted process of decision-making, covering factors like perception, memory efficiency, and motivation. Despite the complexity, a single piece of information can dramatically affect an individual's opinion.

    ### Top-of-the-Head Decisions
    - The text discusses the tendency for many individuals to make quick decisions based on readily accessible information or considerations. This idea is termed as "top-of-the-head" decisions, which often occur because life is too short and the human mind too fallible to consider all available information.

    ### Comprehensive Decisions
    - In contrast, the text also speaks of comprehensive decisions that involve a wider range of considerations. This method is more deliberative and may involve weighing numerous "likes" and "dislikes" about a subject before reaching a conclusion.

---

## Summary
- The chapter wraps up by reiterating the complex interplay among various levels of information, attention to this information, and individual political values. It introduces a model based on these ideas, which will be detailed in the next chapter, that seeks to explain how the "considerations" available to individuals influence their responses to survey questions and decisions in general.

## Chapter 2: Information, predispositions, and opinion

# INFORMATION AND ELITE DISCOURSE

- **Core Theme**
  - Argues that public opinion is shaped by a marriage of information from elite discourse and individual predispositions.

- **Role of Elite Discourse**
  - Explains that political elites provide a highly selective and stereotyped view of world events.
  - Emphasizes that this elite-provided information acts as the base on which public opinion is built.

- **Individual Attention and Values**
  - Highlights that the level of attention an individual pays to information and their own values further shape their opinions.
  - Mentions that the most politically attentive are more likely to adopt elite viewpoints.

- **Public's Desire for Simplicity**
  - Notes that the public generally prefers news that is short, simple, and thematic.
  - Points out that even when given the opportunity for deeper understanding, the public often chooses not to engage.

- **Influence of Stereotypes and Frames**
  - States that cultural and elite-defined stereotypes significantly influence the public's understanding of issues.
  - Adds that these frames determine what the public thinks it is becoming informed about.

- **Effects of Elite Consensus vs. Division**
  - When elites are united in their view, the public largely follows this view.
  - When elites are divided, the public follows those elites who align with their own ideological predispositions.

# Elite discourse and racial attitudes

- #### Early 20th Century Racism in the United States
    - White elites widely accepted racial inferiority theories.
    - Scientific consensus of the time supported racist ideas.
    - Public mobilization for black equality had low chances of success.

- #### Signs of Changing Elite Attitudes by 1930s
    - John Parker's Supreme Court nomination rejected due to a past racist speech.
    - Indicates a shift in elite attitudes towards race.
    - Despite shifts, public issues surrounding race still minimal in 1930s.

- #### Gunnar Myrdal's Observations
    - Predicted an upcoming period of racial progress.
    - Pointed out that changes in white attitudes preceded changes in conditions for blacks.
    - Credited change to shifts in scientific research discrediting racial inferiority theories.

- #### Role of Intellectual and Scientific Developments
    - Shift away from biological explanations of human behavior.
    - Research refocused on the psychological impacts of racial prejudice.

- #### Change in Elite Discourse and Stereotypes
    - Early 20th century discourse focused on racial inferiority.
    - Modern discourse focuses on individual effort and systemic discrimination.

- #### Public Opinion Shifts and Data
    - Massive shift towards greater public support for racial equality.
    - Shift seems to coincide with changes in elite attitudes.
    - The better-educated are more likely to adopt modern elite views on race.

- #### Effects of Partisan Elite Cues
    - Earlier lack of clear partisan differences on racial issues.
    - Post-1963, Democratic party adopts racial liberalism, Republicans become more conservative.
    - Public began to show partisan polarization on racial issues.

- #### Two Types of Public Response
    - Party Conversion: Realigning party loyalties based on racial opinions.
    - Opinion Conversion: Changing racial opinions to match new party leadership cues.

# onceptualizing and Measuring Elite Discourse

- #### Nature of Political Information
- Elite discourse is never just factual; it aims to simplify complex reality for public understanding.
- Such discourse is selective and often framed within stereotypical contexts.
  
- #### Impact on Public Opinion
- Public opinion is rarely a direct response to facts.
- Even direct experiences like poverty and racial inequality are subject to framing and elite perspectives.
- Agrees with Lippmann's view that public opinion is a "moralized and codified version of the facts."

- #### Aim of the Book
- To study how variations in elite discourse affect the direction and organization of mass opinion.
- The book admits that the conceptualization of elite discourse is too complex to be fully measured and tested.
  
- #### Measurement Methods
- Often dichotomous measurements, capturing whether there's a monolithic elite view or diverse opinions.
- Also measures the relative intensity of opposing elite communications over time.
- Simple story counts have shown to be effective for understanding the relationship between elite discourse and mass opinion.
  
- #### Case Study: U.S. Defense Spending
- In late 1970s and early 1980s, media portrayed U.S. defense as weak, which was reflected in public opinion.
- As elite opinions changed, media narratives shifted to highlighting wasteful military spending.
- Public opinion shifted accordingly, moving against increased defense spending.

- #### Final Remarks
- Changes in elite discourse have a direct effect on mass opinion.
- The latter part of the book focuses on analyzing the susceptibility of the public to elite discourse.

# MASS ATTENTION TO ELITE DISCOURSE

# Summary of Text on Political Awareness and Voting Behavior

- ## Role of Political Awareness
  - Refers to how much an individual pays attention to and understands politics.
  - More than just attention, it's about the absorption of political communications.

- ## Relationship with Party Defection
  - Data from the 1978 general election shows a non-linear relationship between political awareness and defection rates.
  - Moderately aware persons are more likely to defect to an incumbent than those at high or low awareness levels.

- ## Complications in Studying Effects
  - Effects are strongly nonlinear, making them hard to detect and model.
  - Public opinion is formed by conflicting information flows, complicating the study.

- ## Multiple Campaigns in Elections
  - Most congressional elections have two main campaigns, each reaching different audiences.
  - The incumbent's campaign generally has more reach.

- ## Multistage Process of Opinion Formation
  - Political awareness affects both exposure to communications and critical reaction to new information.
  - These two effects can be cross-cutting or independent.

- ## Measurement of Political Awareness
  - Several terms like 'political expertise' and 'political involvement' have been used to describe the concept.
  - Best measured by simple tests of neutral factual information about politics.

- ## Neutral vs. Nonneutral Information
  - The text stresses the importance of differentiating between neutral and nonneutral types of information.
  - Uses the term "information" in its nonneutral sense and "tests of political awareness" for neutral factual information.

# POLITICAL PREDISPOSITIONS

# Summary of Political Predispositions and Public Opinion

## Introduction
- **Main Idea**: Citizens are not just passive recipients of media; they have stable traits called "Political Predispositions."
- **Importance**: These traits significantly influence one's political opinions and preferences.

## Function of Predispositions
- **Role**: Acts as an intervening variable between media exposure and political preferences.
- **Formation**: Develop from various life experiences and social factors.

### Assumptions
- **Stability**: Predispositions are stable and not easily influenced by political elites in the short term.

## Types of Predispositions
- **Focus**: The text primarily considers "Political Values" but mentions other factors like race and party attachment.
  
### Definition of Values
- **Explanation**: Values are long-lasting standards or principles.
- **Example**: Economic Individualism and Social Welfare are types of values that influence political opinions.


# WHAT IS AN OPINION?

- **Introduction to Public Opinion**
  - John Mueller starts with caveats that most studies on public opinion miss.
  - Mueller highlights the unusual nature of survey interviews and their potential influence on respondents.
  
- **Issues with Current Surveys**
  - Respondents often feel pressured to appear knowledgeable.
  - Results can be superficial and inconsistent across interviews.
  - Trivial changes in question design can lead to significant changes in aggregate opinion.

- **Effect of Question Phrasing**
  - The way a question is phrased has a large impact on the measure of public support.
  - Cites examples such as "halting the rising crime rate" vs. "law enforcement," showing variations in support based on wording.

- **Analytical Challenges**
  - Most analysts do not want to acknowledge the problematic nature of opinion data for fear of losing credibility.
  - The complex nature of mass opinion is often sidestepped to focus on aspects that are more easily understood.

- **Studyâ€™s Objective**
  - This study aims to address the limitations and problems in collecting opinion data head-on.
  - Introduces a theory to explain why these problems in public opinion surveys exist.

- **Risks and Expectations**
  - Acknowledges that centering the study around the unstable nature of public opinion is risky.
  - Leaves it to the reader to judge the merit of taking such risks in the analysis.


# Problems with mass opinion reports: Over time instability

## Response Instability Over Time
- Two examples highlight that public opinion on important issues fluctuates dramatically over time.
    - In a 1980 survey about U.S.-Soviet relations, only 50% of respondents had consistent opinions between January and June.
    - Another question about government services showed 55% consistency in responses.

## Interpretations and Theories
### Genuine Opinion Change
- The initial assumption might be that people genuinely change their opinions between interviews.
    - However, evidence suggests that third-time responses can be predicted as well from the first interview as the second.

### Chance Variation
- Converse (1964) argues that the instability is due to chance variation.
    - Many people don't have strong opinions but choose randomly when asked.
    - Converse termed the concept as "nonattitudes."

### Stable "True Attitudes"
- A counter-argument suggests that despite fluctuations, citizens have stable "true attitudes."
    - Fluctuations in responses are considered "measurement errors."

## Implications and Issues
### Psychometric Techniques
- Researchers sometimes "correct" the instability through standard psychometric techniques.
    - This makes the variables appear stable and highly correlated with other variables.
    - As a result, the issue of response instability becomes invisible.

### Deficiencies in Existing Theories
- Both Converse's and the "measurement error" theories are considered lacking.
    - Converse's theory doesn't apply to all issues and leaves "crystallization" undefined.
    - The "measurement error" theory is underspecified and largely unexplored.

## Unaddressed Problems
- Researchers have been uncurious about understanding what "measurement error" or "chance variation" really means.
    - It's often treated as a "euphemism for unexplained variance."


# Problems with mass opinion reports: "Response effects"

- **Problems with Mass Opinion Reports: "Response Effects"**
  - **Systematic Error**
    - The text highlights the issue of "systematic error" in opinion reports.
    - Respondents often react to the context, order, and minor alterations in the questions, causing skewed responses.
    - This skewness is termed "response effects."

  - **Example: Soviet Journalist Experiment**
    - 37% agreed to allow Communist reporters in the U.S. when asked without context.
    - 73% agreed when first asked about U.S. reporters in Russia, almost doubling the percentage.
    - Explanation is that when respondents are primed with the concept of reciprocity (U.S. reporters in Russia), they are more inclined to agree with allowing Communist reporters in the U.S.
    
  - **Two Types of Considerations**
    - People don't have a single, fixed opinion but have multiple considerations.
    - In the Soviet journalist example, one consideration is anti-Communism, and the other is the norm of fair play or reciprocity.
    
  - **Other Findings**
    - People claim less interest in politics when asked about obscure issues first.
    - Opinions on abortion are affected by preceding questions related to religion or women's rights.
    - Responses vary significantly between open-ended questions and multiple-choice questions.


# Question-wording effects

- **Overview**
  - The text focuses on the impact of question wording on public opinion in surveys.
  
- **Effect of Question Order**
  - Typically, changing question order affects public opinion by 10-15% or less.

- **Substantive Wording**
  - More significant and reliable shifts in public opinion are observed when changing the substantive wording of questions.
  - General belief: Different questions should elicit different answers based on their emotional loading or subject matter.
  
- **Endorsement Effects**
  - Including the endorsement of a prominent politician can sway public opinion.
  - Contradicts conventional models that assume respondents have pre-existing "true attitudes".

- **Example: Korean War Support**
  - People were more likely to support the war when phrasing focused on anti-communism or implied admitting a mistake would be unpatriotic.
  - Two polls with different wordings yielded 38% and 64% support for the war respectively.

- **Counterargument**
  - Different questions should produce different answers even if people have pre-existing opinions.
  - Deemed not credible as the core issue remains the same, regardless of wording.

- **Case Study: Tversky and Kahneman (1982)**
  - Wording can drastically affect responses even when the underlying issue is the same.
  - Example involved a choice between two healthcare programs, A and C, with the same outcomes but different wording.
  - 72% chose program A when framed as saving lives, while only 22% chose program C when framed as the number of people dying.

- **Conclusion**
  - Differences in question wording can significantly influence how people think and respond, even when the questions are about the same issue.

# The need for a model of the survey response

## Summary of the Text on Survey Responses and Public Opinion

### The Issues with Conventional Survey Models
- 50-75% of the variance in opinion survey items is random "error."
- Question order and wording introduce systematic "error."
- These errors question the traditional belief that surveys reveal "what the public really believes."

### The Shift in Research Focus
- Researchers like Wilson and Hodges have shifted from viewing attitudes as fixed to understanding them as constructed in response to survey questions.
- Tourangeau and Rasinski also propose a model focusing on the "question-answering process."

### The Need for a New Model
- Most research has been limited to studying response effects, not the broader process of opinion formation.
- The author aims to provide a new model that accounts for how opinions are constructed based on varying stimuli and information.
  
### The Proposed Model's Features
- People are continuously exposed to streams of political information but pay low levels of attention.
- Their minds hold a jumble of only partially consistent ideas, and they make quick decisions based on the most accessible ideas when responding to a survey.
- Survey responses change over time because different considerations are salient at different times.

### The Role of Political Awareness
- People who are more politically aware are more selective about the information they internalize.
- Their survey responses are more stable and ideologically consistent due to this selectivity.

# Background of the question-answering model

  - The concept is still new in public opinion but becoming more accepted in psychology.
  - Two major research traditions:
    - **Mathematical Psychologists**: Focus on problem solving
      - Mind as a bin with multiple interpretive constructs.
      - Constructs are chosen stochastically when encountering stimuli.
      - Decisions are made based on ideas that come to mind during problem-solving.
    - **Social Psychologists**: Focus on social cognition
      - Introduce the concept of "schema."
      - Schema organizes information and experience around a central value.
      - Multiple schemata are available for interpreting a single phenomenon.
  
- **How Schemata Influence Perception and Judgment**
  - Different schemata bring different associations and qualities to mind.
  - Not a single attitude towards an object, but multiple attitudes depending on the schema.
  
- **Challenges in Decision Making**
  - Complexity in decision-making due to factors like memory search efficiency and motivation.
  - Tendency to make decisions based on immediately accessible ideas, rather than an exhaustive search of memory.
  
- **Role of Salient Information**
  - A single piece of information can greatly affect opinion.
  - People often seize on a single, sufficient and salient explanation.
  
- **Contrast to Political Science and Cognitive Psychology**
  - Some models show people utilizing multiple pieces of information in their decision-making.
  
- **Proposed Model**
  - Combines top-of-the-head decision-making and information averaging.
  - Decisions are made by averaging over a nonrandom but stochastic sample of relevant considerations.
  - Size and composition of this sample depend on various factors like salient ideas and individual attention to the subject.

- **Summary of the Study**
  - Focuses on three variables:
    - Aggregate-level information in elite discourse.
    - Individual-level attention to this discourse.
    - Individual-level differences in political values.
  - Interactions among these variables determine the "considerations" in people's heads.
  - Availability of these considerations at the moment influences survey responses.

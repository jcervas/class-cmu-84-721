# Summary of Introduction: "Political choice in a polarized America: How elite polarization shapes mass behavior"

## Objectives
- Investigate the impact of **Elite Polarization** (ideological separation among political elites) on **Mass Behavior** (collective actions, attitudes, and voting behaviors of the public).
  
## Key Terms Defined
- **Elite Polarization**: Increasing ideological distance among political elites.
- **Mass Behavior**: Collective actions, attitudes, and voting behaviors of the general public.
- **Policy Orientations**: Individual beliefs towards public policy issues.
- **Partisanship**: Strong allegiance to a political party.
- **Vote Choice**: Decision to vote for a specific candidate or party.

## Data Types Used
- **Panel Data**: Tracks the same individuals over time. Essential for understanding the change within individuals, particularly in terms of policy orientations.
- **Cross-Sectional Time Series Data**: Provides a snapshot at different time intervals across the electorate. Used to analyze how relationships between policy orientations, partisanship, and vote choice have changed over time.

## Argument Structure

### Individual-Level Analysis
- Utilizes data from **American National Election Study (ANES)** and **General Social Survey (GSS)**.
- ANES focuses on political attitudes and behaviors since 1948.
- GSS is more sociological and thus less likely to prime respondents to think in political terms.
- Data span long periods (e.g., ANES from 1972–2016, GSS from 1983–2016) to capture changing mass behavior.

### Elite-Level Analysis
- Data sources include **NOMINATE** data, which assigns ideology scores to members of Congress, and **Americans for Democratic Action (ADA)** rankings.
- Also uses **Shor and McCarty’s State Legislator Ideological Data** for state-level analysis.

## Theory and Claims
- **Primary Theory**: Elite polarization amplifies the effects of policy orientations but only if individual-level policy attitudes are stable.
- **Individual Change**: Argues that individuals align their partisanship based on their policy orientations.
- **Transforming the Electorate**: Longitudinal changes on an individual level can collectively affect the broader electorate.
- **Context Matters**: Claims that much of what we think we know about mass political behavior is an artifact of context. Behavior changes depending on the context, which is shaped by elite behavior.

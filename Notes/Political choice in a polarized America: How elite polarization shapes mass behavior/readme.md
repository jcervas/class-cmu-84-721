# Expanded Outline of Introduction Chapter: "Political choice in a polarized America: How elite polarization shapes mass behavior"

## Research Design

### Objectives

- **Goal**: To assess how relationships between key variables like policy orientations, partisanship, elite polarization, and vote choice have changed over time in the electorate.

### Methodology

- Utilizes two types of data:
    1. **Panel Data**
    2. **Cross-Sectional Time Series Data**

---

## Types of Data and Their Importance

### Panel Data

- **Definition**: Data collected from the same subjects repeatedly over a period of time.
- **Importance**: Vital for tracking changes within individuals. 

### Cross-Sectional Time Series Data

- **Definition**: Data collected at multiple time points but not from the same subjects.
- **Importance**: Used to assess changes across the entire electorate over a long period.

## Theoretical Arguments and Claims

### The Role of Policy Orientations

- **Claim**: Policy orientations are a key political disposition and an important driver of change within individuals.
- **Test**: If individuals align their partisanship according to their policy orientations over time.

### Impact of Elite Polarization

- **Expectation**: Elite polarization amplifies the effect of policy orientations.
- **Condition**: This holds true only if individual level policy attitudes are stable, as shown by repeated panel data.

### Contextual Behavior

- **Argument**: Mass political behavior varies depending on the context, such as the level of elite polarization.
- **Implication**: Traditional models might not be sufficient to explain political behavior across different eras.

## Sources of Data

### Individual-Level Data

- **American National Election Study (ANES)**
    - Long history since 1948
    - Administered every four years
- **General Social Survey (GSS)**
    - Collected annually
    - Not specifically a political survey

### Elite-Level Data

- **NOMINATE Data**
    - Measures legislator ideology
- **Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) Rankings**
    - Rank members of Congress based on roll call votes

## Theoretical Implications

- Changes at the elite level have transformed mass behavior.
- The necessity of data that spans multiple decades.
- New approach in political science, focusing on mass behavior in context.

---

## Advantages of Using Multiple Datasets

- Validates findings and theories.
- Allows the assessment of different question wordings, sampling procedures, etc.

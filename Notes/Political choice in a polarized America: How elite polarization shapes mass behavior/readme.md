# Comprehensive Outline: "Political choice in a polarized America: How elite polarization shapes mass behavior"

## Introduction

### Objectives of the Book

- Analyze how elite polarization has influenced mass political behavior in America.

---

## Research Design

### Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: To understand how the relationships between policy orientations, partisanship, elite polarization, and vote choice have evolved over time.
- **Secondary Goals**: 
    - Test the validity of the theory across multiple datasets.

### Methodological Framework

- Employing a two-pronged data approach:
    1. **Panel Data**
    2. **Cross-Sectional Time Series Data**

## Detailed Discussion of Data Types

### Panel Data

- **Definition**: Longitudinal data collected from the same subjects repeatedly over specific time intervals.
- **Importance**: 
    - To validate the claim that policy orientations are important in shaping individual-level changes.
    - To check whether individuals align their partisanship with their policy orientations over time.
    
### Cross-Sectional Time Series Data

- **Definition**: Data collected at different time points but not necessarily from the same subjects.
- **Importance**:
    - To evaluate changes across the electorate over a long period.
    - To assess how policy orientations and political choices are related at a mass level.

## Theoretical Framework and Claims

### Importance of Policy Orientations

- **Initial Claim**: Policy orientations are pivotal in driving changes within individuals.
- **Theoretical Test**: Observing whether individuals update their partisanship to align with their policy orientations.

### The Role of Elite Polarization

- **Expectation**: Elite polarization increases the impact of policy orientations on individual choices.
- **Conditional Factors**: 
    - The claim is valid only if individual-level policy orientations are stable, as evidenced by panel data.

### The Contextual Nature of Political Behavior

- **Argument**: Mass political behavior is not static but varies according to elite-level changes.
- **Implication**: 
    - Challenges to the traditional models of political behavior.
    - Context such as elite polarization significantly influences mass behavior.

## Data Sources

### Individual-Level Data

- **American National Election Study (ANES)**
    - Coverage: Since 1948, administered every four years.
    - Comprehensive questions on political attitudes and behaviors.
- **General Social Survey (GSS)**
    - Coverage: Conducted annually.
    - Variety of questions on political attitudes but not limited to politics.
    - Less likelihood of expressive responding due to its broad focus.

### Elite-Level Data

- **NOMINATE Data**
    - Provides ideological scores to members of Congress based on roll call votes.
    - Includes two dimensions of ideology: economic left-right and a secondary, historical dimension.
- **Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) Rankings**
    - Ranks Congress members based on specific roll call votes.

## Methodological Rigor and Implications

- Utilizes long-spanning data to observe transformations in mass behavior.
- Adds a novel approach to the study of political behavior by integrating elite-level context.
- The use of multiple independent datasets enhances the validity and comprehensiveness of the study.

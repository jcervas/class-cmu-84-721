# Summary: Introduction to "Political choice in a polarized America: How elite polarization shapes mass behavior"

## Objectives

The introduction sets the stage for an in-depth exploration of how elite polarization influences mass political behavior in America. It aims to answer two core questions:

1. How do policy orientations shape partisanship and vote choice?
2. How has the relationship between these variables evolved under the influence of elite polarization?

## Key Terms

- **Elite Polarization**: Increasing ideological division between political elites.
- **Policy Orientations**: Individual stances on policy issues.
- **Partisanship**: Loyalty to a particular political party.
- **Vote Choice**: The act of voting for a specific candidate or party.

## Research Design

### Panel Data

The author uses panel data, a longitudinal dataset, to assess the impact of policy orientations on partisanship within individuals over time. This type of data is critical for determining if policy orientations are a key driver for changes in individual political alignment.

### Cross-Sectional Time Series Data

The author also employs cross-sectional time series data to analyze how the relationships between partisanship, policy orientations, elite polarization, and vote choice have evolved across the broader electorate.

## Theoretical Claims

### Importance of Policy Orientations

The author argues that policy orientations are a critical political disposition. According to the author, individuals often align their partisanship to match their policy orientations.

### Role of Elite Polarization

The author expects elite polarization to amplify the effects of policy orientations on vote choices. However, this only holds true if individual policy orientations are stable over time, as indicated by the panel data.

## Data Sources

### Individual-Level Data

- **American National Election Study (ANES)**: A comprehensive dataset that focuses on political attitudes.
- **General Social Survey (GSS)**: A broader dataset that is collected annually and includes a variety of topics, not just political issues.

### Elite-Level Data

- **NOMINATE Data**: Provides ideological scores for legislators based on roll-call votes.
- **Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) Rankings**: Ranks legislators based on key votes.

## Methodological and Theoretical Contributions

The author's approach is novel in that it integrates both individual and elite-level factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of political choice. This enables a nuanced interpretation of how policy orientations and partisanship interact within varying contextual environments defined by elite polarization.

## Conclusion

The introduction establishes the theoretical and methodological framework for exploring how elite polarization has shaped mass behavior in the American political landscape. It argues that understanding the influence of policy orientations and partisanship, and how they interact within a polarized context, is key to unlocking the complexities of political behavior.

## Research Design and Objectives

### Purpose and Goals

- **Primary Goal**: To understand how policy orientations, partisanship, and vote choice are influenced by elite polarization.
- **Secondary Goal**: To validate the theory through the use of multiple datasets and research methods.

### Types of Data Employed

#### Panel Data

- **Definition**: Longitudinal data that tracks changes in the same individuals over time.
- **Importance**: Critical for observing how policy orientations influence partisanship and vice versa.

#### Cross-Sectional Time Series Data

- **Definition**: Data collected from different individuals at multiple points in time.
- **Importance**: Allows for analysis across broader populations and timeframes.

## Data Sources and Their Merits

### Individual-Level Data

#### American National Election Study (ANES)

- Comprehensive, specific to political attitudes, and spans multiple decades.

#### General Social Survey (GSS)

- Collected annually, covers broad topics, and valuable for less politically-charged responses.

### Elite-Level Data

#### NOMINATE Data

- **Definition**: Assigns ideology scores to legislators based on roll-call votes.
  
#### Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) Rankings

- **Definition**: Ranks members of Congress based on key roll-call votes each year.

## Methodological Rigor and Novelty

- Uses longitudinal data to capture changes over time.
- Novel in integrating both individual and contextual (elite-level) variables into models of political choice.

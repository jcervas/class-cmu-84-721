# Comprehensive Outline: "Political choice in a polarized America: How elite polarization shapes mass behavior"

## Introduction

### Book Objectives

- Analyze the impact of elite polarization on mass political behavior.
- Evaluate how the relationships between policy orientations, partisanship, elite polarization, and vote choice have evolved over time.

---

## Research Design and Objectives

### Purpose and Goals

- **Primary Goal**: Understand the long-term evolution of the relationship between policy orientations, partisanship, and vote choice in a polarized environment.
- **Secondary Goal**: Validate the theory by using multiple datasets and methods.

### Data Types Employed

- **Panel Data**: Longitudinal data that tracks the same individuals over a span of time.
- **Cross-Sectional Time Series Data**: Data collected at different time points, not necessarily from the same subjects.

## Data Types: Detailed Discussion

### Panel Data

#### Definition and Importance

- Longitudinal data for observing individual-level changes.
- Validates if policy orientations drive partisanship.
  
#### Objectives

- To establish that policy orientations influence individual-level changes.
- To track the alignment of partisanship and policy orientations over time.

### Cross-Sectional Time Series Data

#### Definition and Importance

- Data for broad electorate-wide insights.
- Critical for evaluating how the relationships between variables have changed at the mass level.

#### Objectives

- To analyze the electorate-wide impact of policy orientations and elite polarization on political choices.
- To test the theory across broad timescales and populations.

## Theoretical Claims and Expectations

### Role of Policy Orientations

- Claim: Policy orientations are pivotal in shaping individual behavior.
  
### Impact of Elite Polarization

- Elite polarization amplifies the impact of policy orientations on political choices.
  
### Individual and Contextual Factors

- How policy orientations and partisanship matter is context-dependent, especially with changes at the elite level.

## Data Sources and Their Merits

### Individual-Level Data

- **ANES (American National Election Study)**
    - Comprehensive, long-standing, and focused on politics.
- **GSS (General Social Survey)**
    - Broad and annually conducted; valuable for less politically-charged responses.
  
### Elite-Level Data

- **NOMINATE Data**
    - Ideological scoring based on roll call votes; captures economic left-right dimensions.
- **ADA (Americans for Democratic Action) Rankings**
    - Yearly rankings based on key roll call votes.

### Additional Measures

- **Shor and McCartyâ€™s State Legislator Ideological Data**
    - Measures state-level ideological polarization.

## Methodological Rigor and Novelty

- Longitudinal approach captures changes that shorter studies may miss.
- Novelty in integrating elite-level context into individual-level behavior models.
- Multiple datasets strengthen the validity of the study's claims.

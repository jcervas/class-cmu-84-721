## Scope and Purpose

- This course examines prominent classic and contemporary works in the two major subfields in American politics, political institutions, and political behavior.

- The seminar will address topics such as Congress, presidency, bureaucracy, and courts, but also public opinion, elections, campaigns, political parties, and the importance of geography, wealth, ethnicity, gender, and religion in politics, among other subjects.

- There will be an emphasis on analyzing and appraising the theory, methodology, and contributions of the selected readings.

- This course will include advanced undergraduates as well as graduate students.

## Course Objectives

- The purpose of this course is to introduce students to major themes and some of the best scholarship from political science literature. The course emphasizes breadth over depth.

- To facilitate discussion, it is important that you write as well as read and think in advance about how the readings address the overall topic for that session. The course will include empirical data to better examine theoretical questions and to situate the course in modern politics and current events.

- The two most important skills that introductory graduate students need to master are the abilities to understand the development of literature and the ability to write critically, succinctly, and objectively about these literatures. To this end, the main writing requirements for this course are papers that seek to help students develop these skills. These papers are not summaries or personal responses (thus, lines of thoughts and phrases such as "I really liked...", "My feelings on the matter..." etc. are irrelevant to these assignments).

## Participation

It is important that you discuss the readings with your fellow students (who benefit from hearing how others interpret the literature); you will also be expected to contribute to the overall knowledge of the class. Your perspective on the political world, the news media you consume, and your interpretation of both historical and contemporary politics are different than others, and I expect that you will share those. To this end, you will be encouraged to track presidential approval ratings, political polls, election forecast predictions, economic indicators (like unemployment), and other such data. Following current events will help facilitate discussion throughout the semester.

Everyone will be reading from this core text:

**A Different Democracy** -- Taylor, Steven L., Matthew Soberg Shugart, Arend Lijphard, and Bernard Grofman. 2014. *A Different Democracy: American Government in a 31-Country Perspective*. Yale University Press. ([Purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O56PUVO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1))

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

> Everyone has an equal voice in this course. When you disagree, challenge, or respond to the idea, not the person. Nobody has a monopoly on opinion or time, and I will do my best to allow each of you to speak your mind and adjust the course accordingly so that everyone gets value from their time. My main goal is to give you value, and I am open to changes that allow for that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have divided the class into 8 sections/topics, some of which are reflected in the required readings, and others which are only part of the optional readings. Unfortunately, we will not have enough time to cover all topics pertinent to American politics in full. You will find additional topics and recommended readings at the end of the syllabus. If these topics are of interest to you, I encourage you to select papers from those sections and present them to the class.

---


## Writing Assignments

(1) **Weekly additional reading:** Every week (starting week 2, Sept 6), you are to select one paper from the list of optional readings at the end of this syllabus, or one not on the list but that fits the section we are currently focused on. You will read this paper and create an outline (a bullet point outline, literally) that tells us the thesis, findings, and conclusions. You may choose to write in prose (should not exceed one page, max), but it is not required. We will share these with the class for others to use when preparing their area specialization papers. My hope is, because you all have a variety of interests, that we will get significant variation on papers to cover most of those I have listed, or others you find interesting. That said, it is okay if several people read the same paper.

The purpose of this exercise is to help you find the key insights from the readings, understand the empirical or intellectual contribution, and how it fits into the field more broadly. This is additionally helpful because it will allow for quick reference if you are writing a term paper on the subject. This is the equivalent of an annotated bibliography, but you can structure them in whatever way is most helpful for you. These are the notes you take while you read. I am not interested in grading grammar or spelling for this task. We will combine everyone's contribution in a shared, editable document, so each person has a summary of all articles assigned this quarter and can contribute additional insights.

(1a) **Mini lecture:** On two occasions you will present one of these papers to the class; a mini "lecture." PowerPoints are not necessary, though you are welcome to use any additional presentation skills, including analyzing new data or sharing YouTube videos, PowerPoint, and other visual aids, if applicable. This is part of your participation grade, along with the reading assignment grade.

(2) **Op-ed/Editorial/Blog:** Prepare a short essay advocating for (or against) any social or political issue of your choosing (topics relating to American politics). The idea is that you will write something that can be submitted to a newspaper or internet blog. There is a strict 1,250-word limit. Concise arguments made for a more general audience are the goal of this assignment; something your parents can read and understand. The use of data and visualizations is strongly encouraged and is not included in the word count. We will circulate drafts on September 26 to one other graduate student who will offer critiques and/or proofreading. On October 7, we will circulate all the final drafts. These will be the reading assignments for October 11.

(3) **Book Review/Summary:** You are to choose one book of your choice of academic nature, regarding any subject on American politics. I have a wide selection of books you can choose from, or you can utilize the library to find a book. Your instructor will help you find something that is relevant to your interests along with being germane to the subjects in the course. In total, the book review should be no longer than 6-8 pages, double-spaced. It should tell the reader the subject of the book, what it did well, what it left out, and your own thoughts about its relevance or importance. You should choose a book that can help give insight into your area specialization paper.

(4) **Area Specialization Paper:** In lieu of a final exam, you are to choose either one of the subjects we explore during the course or a topic of your choosing (see below) and do a literature review and develop one, or several, hypotheses. The professor can help you find relevant articles and provide strategies for conducting research. You will submit a 5-8 single-spaced page paper (not including references and title page) that does the following:

- Synthesizes the contributions made by the assigned readings to current scholarly understanding in the specific field area (e.g., campaigns and elections; mass or elite polarization; judicial independence; gerrymandering)

- Identifies one or two lingering questions raised by the readings and explains specifically why those questions are important to furthering our understanding of the field area

- Outlines and discusses a research design with the potential to answer the lingering question(s). Explain why the design is optimal for addressing the question(s) and acknowledge limitations of the design.

The specialization paper will help you build your skills in the areas of synthesizing works for a literature review, formulating research questions, and devising appropriate methodologies for answering those questions. This paper is a critical evaluation that explains the literature's strengths and weaknesses with respect to the goals and process of social scientific research and that charts their impact on subsequent research. Students may find it helpful to consult many published articles in preparing their papers. Any information taken from these sources must be cited appropriately and is used to augment students' own analysis. To create a literature review you need not read thoroughly every paper you cite, just well enough to make the connection between your through/story and their findings. Though I am asking you to produce a research design that proposes tests for one or several hypotheses, you will not need to conduct empirical analyses (though you certainly may, and I encourage you to, if possible). You should describe the data that would be necessary to evaluate your hypotheses. The paper you write in this class may be the basis of your master's thesis or other future publications. Formatting should be consistent throughout, though no style is required. You will, during the final week, give the class a presentation of your papers, summarizing the books and articles you have read. ~20 mins

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

> Examples of deep dives topics include incumbency advantage in American elections, state legislative professionalization, polarization (mass and elite), economic inequality, racial resentment, election forecasting, women in politics, segregation and other spatial context issues, gerrymandering, policy diffusion, and so on. The amount of research done on American politics is infinite, so we cannot cover everything during the semester. This assignment allows us to dial into a topic you find most interesting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Readings

The assigned readings present only a starting point for people looking to specialize in American politics. You should consult the instructors for recommendations of further essential readings beyond those assigned here. It is expected that every week you will have engaged the readings closely and critically, and that you come to class prepared to participate in rigorous discussion of them. Specifically, you should be able to address the following upon reading each work.

- What are the main themes of the work?
- What are the main contributions of this work to our understanding of politics?
- What are the limitations of or areas for improvement for this work (focusing on its theoretical argument, hypotheses, evidence, analysis, interpretation of results, etc.)?
- What did you not understand about this work?
- What next steps can you envision to effectively build on the major contributions of this work?

Readings will draw heavily from the *Annual Review of Political Science*, a journal that "covers significant developments in the field of Political Science." This allows you to get a considerable overview of the field, while not costing you any money!

My expectation is that you will "read" all the assigned articles, but I recognize that I have assigned quite a lot. You should minimally *skim* all the assigned readings. Learning good skimming skills is particularly important; arguably, the most important thing you can learn as a graduate student. Journal articles follow a very formulaic outline, which makes skimming easy. You will need to be sure to capture enough of the content to discuss the article with your peers. *Annual Review* articles are to be read more thoroughly since they cover a larger amount of literature than other types of one-issue articles.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

> Like American democracy itself, this syllabus is subject to amendment.
> The process of amendment is as follows: (1) all students and the professor get one vote; (2) a simple majority of voters agree to a change; (3) a student's vote is weighted as 1/n where n=number of students and a professor has a vote weighted as n+1. All amendments will be announced publicly, and no student shall be injured by changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Class will be organized under several general topics, ranging from theory and design of American democracy to polarization, identity formation, political communication, and others. The readings listed below are required. You are also expected to choose from the other reading list a series of articles throughout the semester, as detailed above.

## Academic Integrity:

Academic Integrity is a core CMU value, and as a member of the CMU community, it is important that the work you turn in for this class is wholly your own. As your instructor, I will strive to ensure that you develop the necessary knowledge and skills to meet the learning objectives for this class, just as it is your task to put in the effort to complete the work and ask for help if you need it. I am flexible if you need accommodations -- just reach out!

As a reminder all students should follow [CMU's Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html).

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:

If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodation and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodation is provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

## Student Wellness:

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological Services: 412-268-2922

**TimelyCare at CMU:**

All of this will be available 24/7 from anywhere in the United States, with no cost to visit.

## Diversity Statement:

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can plan accordingly.

## Late Work:

In general, submitting assignments on time lets me provide feedback in a more timely and efficient manner. Assignments build on each other, so timely submissions are crucial to your progress in the class. However, sometimes life happens. If you cannot submit an assignment on time, the default will be that you will be eligible for 90% of the grade the first 48 hours that the assignment is late. If you must submit beyond 48 hours past the due date, please contact me cervas@cmu.edu as soon as possible so we can plan.

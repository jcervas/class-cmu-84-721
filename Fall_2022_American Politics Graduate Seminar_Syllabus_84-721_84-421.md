## Scope and Purpose:

- This course examines prominent classic and contemporary works in the two major subfields in American politics, political institutions, and political behavior.

- This seminar will address topics such as Congress, presidency, bureaucracy, and courts, but also public opinion, elections, campaigns, political parties, and the importance of geography, wealth, ethnicity, gender, and religion in politics, among other subjects.

- There will be an emphasis on analyzing and appraising the theory, methodology, and contributions of the selected readings.

- This course will include advanced undergraduates as well as graduate students.

## Course Objectives:

- The purpose of this course is to introduce students to major themes and some of the best scholarships from political science literature. This course emphasizes breadth over depth.

- To facilitate discussion, it is important that you write as well as read and think in advance about how the readings address the overall topic for that session. I will infuse the course with empirical data to better examine theoretical questions and to situate the course in modern politics and current events.

- The two most important skills that introductory graduate students need to master are the abilities to understand the development of literature and the ability to write critically, succinctly, and objectively about these literatures. To this end, the main writing requirements for this course are papers that seek to help students develop these skills. These papers are not summaries or personal responses (thus, lines of thoughts and phrases such as "I really liked...", "My feelings on the matter..." etc. are irrelevant to these assignments).

## Important Dates (Assignments due by 11:59pm):

## Participation:

It is important that you discuss the readings with your fellow students (who benefit from hearing how others interpret the literature); you will also be expected to contribute to the overall knowledge of the class. Your perspective on the political world, the news media you consume, and your interpretation of both historical and contemporary politics are different than others, and I expect that you will share those. To this end, you will be encouraged to track presidential approval ratings, political polls, election forecast predictions, economic indicators (like unemployment), and other such data. Following current events will help facilitate discussion throughout the semester.

Everyone will be reading from this core text:

**A Different Democracy** -- Taylor, Steven L., Matthew Soberg Shugart, Arend Lijphard, and Bernard Grofman. 2014. *A Different Democracy: American Government in a 31-Country Perspective*. Yale University Press. ([Purchase here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O56PUVO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1))

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Everyone has an equal voice in this course. When you disagree,
  challenge, or respond to the idea, not the person. Nobody has a
  monopoly on opinion or time, and I will do my best to allow each of you
  to speak your mind and adjust the course accordingly so that everyone
  gets value from their time. My main goal is to give you value, and I am
  open to changes that allow for that.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have divided the class into 8 sections/topics, some of which are
reflected in the required readings, and others which are only part of
the optional readings. Unfortunately, we will not have enough time to
cover all topics pertinent to American politics in full. You will find
additional topics and recommended readings at the end of the syllabus.
If these topics are of interest to you, I encourage you to select papers
from those sections and present them to the class.

## Writing assignments:

1. **Weekly additional reading**: Each week, starting in week 3, you will be responsible for a short discussion about the 3rd paper (i.e. the paper for that week) that we are reading. This is essentially a summary paragraph and discussion question (the question should take up the bulk of the paper). You will submit this paper on Canvas.

2. **Op-Ed/Editorial/Blog**: Your assignment is to write an op-ed/editorial/blog of about 1000-1200 words (approximately 3-4 pages, double-spaced) to be published. I would like your op-ed to take a position on some topic related to American politics and to be based on your research. You will pick the topic and clear it with me. There will be an accompanying peer-review process to be explained in more detail later. You will submit the first draft of your op-ed on Canvas by the date listed above.

3. **Book Review/Summary**: You will write a 1500-word (approximately 5-6 pages, double-spaced) paper summarizing and assessing one of the assigned books for this course. The review must include a brief overview of the book's main arguments, an evaluation of the book's strengths and weaknesses, and your overall assessment of its contribution to the study of American politics. I would like for you to focus your evaluation on the significance of the book's contribution and how it fits into broader debates in the field. You will submit this paper on Canvas by the date listed above.

4. **Area Specialization Paper**: This paper will be the longest and most research-intensive paper for this course. The paper should be 3500 words (approximately 14 pages, double-spaced) in length. The goal of this paper is to allow you to explore a subfield or a topic of American politics in more depth than we will have the opportunity to do so during the semester. More specific information on this paper will be provided later on in the semester. You will submit this paper on Canvas by the date listed above.

## Readings:

Readings will be posted as pdfs on Canvas. There are 8 sections of this course, and each section is assigned 4-5 required readings, with additional suggested readings. The required readings cover all necessary information for the course. The suggested readings can be used as a supplement to the required readings or to delve deeper into a particular topic if you are interested.

These are the required books:

## Facial coverings: {#facial-coverings .jc-diss-table-head}

We will follow whatever protocol is provided by the university.

## Academic Integrity: {#academic-integrity .jc-diss-table-head}

Academic Integrity is a core CMU value, and as a member of the CMU
community, it is important that the work you turn in for this class is
wholly your own. As your instructor, I will strive to ensure that you
develop the necessary knowledge and skills to meet the learning
objectives for this class, just as it is your task to put in the effort
to complete the work and ask for help if you need it. I am flexible if
you need accommodations -- just reach out!

As a reminder all students should follow [CMU's Academic Integrity
Policy](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html).

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: {#accommodations-for-students-with-disabilities .jc-diss-table-head}

If you have a disability and have an accommodation letter from the
Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your
accommodation and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I
will work with you to ensure that accommodation is provided as
appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would
benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office
of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
access@andrew.cmu.edu.

## Student Wellness: {#student-wellness .jc-diss-table-head}

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can

## Diversity Statement:  {#diversity-statement .jc-diss-table-head}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well served by this course, that students' learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and
benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are
encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the
effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or
student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings conflict with
your religious events, please let me know so that we can plan
accordingly.

## Late Work:  {#late-work .jc-diss-table-head}

In general, submitting assignments on time lets me provide feedback in a
more timely and efficient manner. Assignments build on each other, so
timely submissions are crucial to your progress in the class. However,
sometimes life happens. If you cannot submit an assignment on time, the
default will be that you will be eligible for 90% of the grade the first
48 hours that the assignment is late. If you must submit beyond 48 hours
past the due date, please contact me cervas@cmu.edu as soon as possible
so we can plan.
